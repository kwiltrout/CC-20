				Armstrong’s first mission into the space was as command pilot of Gemini 8 in 1966. With this, he
				became the first civilian to fly in space. His second and last space flight occurred three years later in
				1969 when he joined Aldrin and Collins aboard Apollo 11 for NASA’s first manned mission to moon.
